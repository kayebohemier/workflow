            "text": "DataRescue Workflow\n\n\nThis document describes DataRescue activities both at in-person events and remotely, as developed by the \nDataRefuge project\n and \nEDGI\n. It explains the process that a URL/dataset goes through from the time it has been identified, either by a \nSeeder\n as difficult to preserve, or  \"uncrawlable,\" until it is made available as a record in the \ndatarefuge.org\n data catalog. The process involves several stages and is designed to maximize smooth hand-offs. At each step the data is with someone with distinct expertise and the data is always being tracked for security.\n\n\n\n\nEvent Organizers\n\n\nLearn about what you need to do to \nbefore\n and \nafter\n an event.\n\n\nEvent Attendees\n\n\n\n\nJoin the event Slack team recommended by event organizers, this is often the \nDataRefuge Slack\n. During the event people share expertise and answer each other's questions here.  \n\n\nPick your role from the paths below, get account credentials, and make sure you have access to the key documents and tools you need to work. Organizers will instruct you on these steps.\n\n\nReview the relevant sections(s) of this workflow.\n\n\n\n\nPath I. Website Archiving\n\n\nSeeding\n\n\nSeeders canvass the resources of a given government agency, identifying important URLs. They identify whether those URLs can be crawled by the Internet Archive's webcrawler. If the URLs are crawlable, the Seeders nominate them to the End-of-Term (EOT) project. Otherwise, they add them to the Archivers app using the project's Chrome Extension.\n\n\nPath II. Archiving More Complex Datasets\n\n\nA. \nResearching\n\n\nResearchers inspect the \"uncrawlable\" list to confirm that Seeders' assessments were correct (that is, that the URL/dataset is indeed uncrawlable), and investigate how the dataset could be best harvested. \nResearching.md\n describes this process in more detail.\n\n\nWe recommend that Researchers and Harvesters (see below) work together in pairs, as much communication is needed between the two roles. In some cases, one person will fulfill both roles.\n\n\nB. \nHarvesting\n\n\nHarvesters take the \"uncrawlable\" data and try to figure out how to actually capture it based on the recommendations of the Researchers. This is a complex task which can require substantial technical expertise and different techniques for different tasks. Harvesters should also review the \nHarvesting Toolkit\n for tools.\n\n\nC. \nChecking/Bagging\n\n\nCheckers inspect a harvested dataset and make sure that it is complete. The main question the checkers need to answer is \"will the bag make sense to a scientist\"? Checkers need to have an in-depth understanding of harvesting goals and potential content variations for datasets. \n \nNote: Checking is currently performed by Baggers and does not exist as a separate stage in the Archivers app.\n\n\nBaggers perform some quality assurance on the dataset to make sure the content is correct and corresponds to the original URL. Then they package the data into a bagit file (or \"bag\"), which includes basic technical metadata, and upload it to the final DataRefuge destination.\n\n\nD. \nDescribing\n\n\nDescribers create a descriptive record in the DataRefuge CKAN repository for each bag. Then they link the record to the bag and make the record public.\n\n\n\n\nPartners\n\n\nDataRescue is a broad, grassroots effort with support from numerous local and nationwide networks. \nDataRefuge\n and \nEDGI\n partner with local organizers in supporting these events. See more of our institutional partners on the \nDataRefuge home page\n.",

A \nprimer\n is a basic description of the units within a Department (e.g., the Department of Justice), along with its agencies and sub-agencies. These primers are used by \nseeders and sorters\n to check the subagency web sites for uncrawlable data. If a Department has no primer, or if it has limited agency and subagency information in its primer, it isn't ready for seeders and sorters to use. Some individuals at the event on Saturday will be creating primers to seed future events at other institutions. If you have concerns about social science data in particular, writing a primer on Saturday is a good way to ensure that something gets done at future events.\n\n\nWe will focus on the Office of Water in the EPA because a primer has been written for that agency.\n\n\nData Rescue is focusing on identifying \nnew\n datasets. Long-term preservation is a future phase of the project, but \nthere are already conversations like this one\n about what that might look like.",

By meaningful we mean: \"will the bag make sense to a scientist\"?\n\n\nFor instance, if a dataset is composed of a spreadsheet without any accompanying key or explanation of what the data represents, it might be completely impossible for a scientist to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Set up as a Harvester\n\n\n\n\nThe organizers of the event (in-person or remote) will tell you how to volunteer for the Harvester role, either through Slack or a form.\n\n\nThey will send you an invite to the \nArchivers app\n, which helps us coordinate all the data archiving work we do.\n\n\nClick the invite link, and choose a username and a password.

Claiming a Dataset to Harvest\n\n\n\n\nYou will work on datasets that were confirmed as uncrawlable by Researchers.\n\n\nGo to the \nArchivers app\n, click \nURLS\n and then \nHARVEST\n: all the URLs listed are ready to be harvested.\n\n\nAvailable URLs are the ones that have not been checked out by someone else, i.e. that do not have someone's name in the User column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect an available URL and click its UUID to get to the detailed view, then click \nCheckout this URL\n. It is now ready for you to work on, and no one else can do anything to it while you have it checked out.\n\n\nWhile you go through the harvesting process, make sure to report as much information as possible in the Archivers app, as this is the place were we collectively keep track of all the work done.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nNote: URL vs UUID\n \n  \n  The \nURL\n is the link to examine and harvest, and the \nUUID\n is a canonical ID we use to connect the URL with the data in question. The UUID will have been generated earlier in the process. UUID stands for Universal Unique Identifier.\n\n\n\n\n2. Investigate the Dataset\n\n\n2a. Classify Source Type \n Archivability\n\n\nBefore doing anything, take a minute to understand what you're looking at. It's usually best to do a quick check of the URL to confirm that this data in fact not crawlable. Often as part of the harvesting team, you'll be the first person with a higher level of technical knowledge to review the URL in question.\n\n\nCheck for False-Positives (Content That Is in Fact Crawlable)\n\n\nGenerally, any URL that returns standard HTML, links to more \nHTML mimetype pages\n, and contains little-to-no non-HTML content, is crawlable. \"View source\" from your browser of choice will help see what the crawler itself is seeing. If in fact the data can be crawled, nominate it to the Internet Archive using the \nEDGI Nomination Chrome Extension\n, click the \nDo not harvest\n checkbox in the Research section of the Archivers app, click \nCheckin this URL\n, and move on to another URL.\n\n\nSome Things to Think About While Reviewing a URL\n\n\n\n\nDoes this page use JavaScript to render its content, especially to \ngenerate links\n or \ndynamically pull up images and PDF content\n? Crawlers generally cannot parse dynamically generated content.\n\n\nDoes this URL contain links to non-HTML content? (For example, zip files, PDFs, Excel files, etc...)\n\n\nIs this URL some sort of interface for a large database or service? (For example, an interactive map, API gateway, etc.)\n\n\nDoes this URL contain instructions for connecting to a server, database, or other special source of data?\n\n\n\n\nCheck the Terms of Service!\n\n\nBefore you go any further, it is \nalways\n worth confirming that the data in question is in fact open for archiving. If the terms of service explicitly prohibit archiving, \nmake a note of it\n. Generally archive-a-thons are purposely only aimed at publically available data, but it is easy to follow a link away from a publically available source onto a site that has different terms of service.\n\n\nData acquired outside terms of service is not usable.\n\n\n2b. Determine Scale of the Dataset\n\n\nIf the dataset you're looking at is quite large -- say, more than 1000 documents -- capturing it may require more elaborate programming than is described here, and it may be difficult to complete in the timeframe of the event. In that case, you may want to look outside the scope of this document and read the documentation of tools such as the \nEIS WARC archiver\n, which shows how to initiate a larger, fully automated harvest on a web-based virtual machine. Talk to your DataRescue guide to determine how to best proceed.\n\n\n3. Generate HTML, JSON \n Directory\n\n\nTo get started, click \nDownload Zip Starter\n, which will download an empty zip archive structure for the data you are about to harvest.\nThe structure looks like this:\n\n\nDAFD2E80-965F-4989-8A77-843DE716D899\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 DAFD2E80-965F-4989-8A77-843DE716D899.html\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 DAFD2E80-965F-4989-8A77-843DE716D899.json\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 /tools\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 /data\n\n\n\n\nEach row in the above is:\n\n\nA directory named by the UUID\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 a .html \nweb archive\n file of the URL for future reference, named with the ID\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 a .json metadata file that contains relevant metadata, named with the ID\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 a /tools directory to include any scripts, notes \n files used to acquire the data\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 a /data directory that contains the data in question\n\n\n\n\nFolder Structure\n\n\nUUID\n\n\nThe goal is to pass this finalized folder off for \n\"bagging\"\n. We repeatedly use the UUID so that we can programmatically work through this data later. It is important that the ID be copied \nexactly\n wherever it appears, with no leading or trailing spaces, and honoring case-sensitivity.\n\n\n[UUID].html file\n\n\nThe zip starter archive will automatically include a copy of the page corresponding to the URL. The HTML file gives the archive a snapshot of the page at the time of archiving which we can use to monitor for changing data in the future, and corroborate the provenance of the archive itself. We can also use the \n.html\n in conjunction with the scripts you'll include in the tools directory to replicate the archive in the future.\n\n\n[UUID].json file\n\n\nYou'll need to inspect the .json manifest to be sure all fields are correct. This file contains vital data, including the url that was archived and date of archiving. The manifest should contain the following fields:\n\n\n{\n    \nDate of capture\n: \n,\n    \nFile formats contained in package\n: \n,\n    \nFree text description of capture process\n: \n,\n    \nIndividual source or seed URL\n: \n,\n    \nInstitution facilitating the data capture creation and packaging\n: \n,\n    \nName of package creator\n: \n,\n    \nName of resource\n: \n,\n    \nType(s) of content in package\n: \n,\n    \nrecommended_approach\n: \n,\n    \nsignificance\n: \n,\n    \ntitle\n: \n,\n    \nurl\n: \n\n}\n\n\n\n\n[UUID]/tools/\n\n\nDirectory containing any scripts, notes \n files used to acquire the data. Put any scripts you write or tools you use into this directory. This is useful in case new data needs to be archived from the same site again at a later date.\n\n\n[UUID]/data/\n\n\nDirectory containing the data in question.\n\n\n4. Acquire the Data\n\n\nYour method for doing this will depend on the shape and size of the data you're dealing with. A few methods are described below.\n\n\n4a. Identify Data Links \n Acquire Them in a wget Loop\n\n\nIf you encounter a page that links to lots of data (for example a \"downloads\" page), this approach may work well. It's important to only use this approach when you encounter \ndata\n, for example PDF's, .zip archives, .csv datasets, etc.\n\n\nThe tricky part of this approach is generating a list of URLs to download from the page. If you're skilled with using scripts in combination with html-parsers (for example python's wonderful \nbeautiful-soup package\n), go for it. Otherwise, we've included the \njquery-url-extraction guide\n, which has the advantage of working within a browser and can operate on a page that has been modified by JavaScript.\n\n\nOur example dataset uses jquery-URL, \nleveraging that tool to generate a list of URLs to feed the wget loop\n.\n\n\n4b. Identify Data Links \n Acquire Them via WARCFactory\n\n\nFor search results from large document sets, you may need to do more sophisticated \"scraping\" and \"crawling\" -- again, check out tools built at previous events such as the \nEIS WARC archiver\n or the \nEPA Search Utils\n for ideas on how to proceed.\n\n\n4c. FTP Download\n\n\nGovernment datasets are often stored on FTP. It's pretty easy to crawl these FTP sites with a simple Python script. Have a look at \ndownload_ftp_tree.py\n as an example. Note that the Internet Archive is doing an FTP crawl, so another option (especially if the dataset is large) would be to nominate this as a seed (though FTP seeds should be nominated \nseparately\n from HTTP seeds).\n\n\n4d. API Scrape / Custom Solution\n\n\nIf you encounter an API, chances are you'll have to build some sort of custom solution, or investigate a social angle. For example: asking someone with greater access for a database dump.\n\n\n4e. Automated Full Browser\n\n\nThe last resort of harvesting should be to drive it with a full web browser. It is slower than other approaches such as \nwget\n, \ncURL\n, or a headless browser. Additionally, this implementation is prone to issues where the resulting page is saved before it's done loading. There is a \nruby example\n.\n\n\nTips\n\n\n\n\nIf you encounter a search bar, try entering \"*\" to see if that returns \"all results\".\n\n\nLeave the data unmodified. During the process, you may feel inclined to clean things up, add structure to the data, etc. Avoid temptation. Your finished archive will be hashed so we can compare it later for changes, and it's important that we archive original, unmodified content.\n\n\n\n\n5. Complete [UUID].json \n Add /tools\n\n\nFrom there you'll want to complete the [UUID].json.

            "text": "The \nArchivers.space\n application is extremely fresh, we have some known issues and workarounds documented below.\n\n\n1) I'm looking at a URL, but I can't edit anything!\n\n\nMake sure you have clicked the big blue button \"\nCheckout this URL\n\" near the top. None of the fields can be edited until the URL is checked out.\n\n\n2) Why are URLs that may have already been archived by Ann Arbor available to research?\n\n\nWhen selecting a URL to review \"\n0\n\" is the \ndefault\n priority; it generally means that no-one has reviewed it \nUNLESS\n it says \nMAY HAVE BEEN HARVESTED AT ANN ARBOR\n.\n\n\nIn those cases, assign the priority to \"\n1\n\", so the URL drops down in the queue and then \nSKIP IT\n.\n\n\n3) What does it mean if it says \nCrawled by Internet Archive\n: Yes?\n\n\n\"\nCrawled by Internet Archive\n\" means the \npage itself\n was crawled; it may or may not mean the \ndataset\n was crawled.\n\n\nBased on what Heretrix \nCan and Can't Crawl\n, you will need to judge whether the dataset will be captured by the Internet Archive crawl and use your best judgement about whether to mark as \nDo not harvest\n.\n\n\n4) How should I handle overly broad sites with just a search form, e.g. noaa.gov?\n\n\nIn cases like \nnoaa.gov\n, you have to investigate  and try to find the data source a page is referencing and whether or not there is some way to query that data.\nIn many cases, it might be difficult or near impossible to isolate and query, depending on the kind of database.\n\n\nComplete the \nResearch\n section to the best of your abilities, especially the \nRecommended Approach for Harvesting Data\n.\n\n\n5) Do we have a scripting system set up preserving data or data endpoints that are updated regularly?\n\n\nNot yet; addressing these datasets is a goal going-forward.\n\n\nCurrently, indicate in the notes in both the \nResearch\n and \nHarvest\n sections that the dataset is updated regularly, and mark it complete anyway (note decision per @mattprice/this FAQ).\n\n\n6) What if I have a site and want to know if it has been crawled already?\n\n\nInternet Archive has both a \nWayback Machine Chrome Extension\n and \nAPIs\n you can use to check if something has been archived:\n\n\n\n\nWayback Machine Chrome Extension\n\n\nYou can also check on the Internet Archive site directly at \narchive.org/web/\n\n\nWayback CDX Server API\n\n\n\n\nThere is a \ncheck-ia\n script in the \nharvesting tools\n for batch URLs.\n\n\n7) What if the site has in fact been crawled well by the Internet Archive?\n\n\nIf the site includes only crawlable data, then there is no need to harvest it. These should be marked \nDo not harvest\n in the \nResearch\n phase.\n\n\nIf the site includes one of the forms of uncrawlable content:\n\n1) FTP\n\n2) Many Files\n\n3) Database\n\n4) Visualization/Interactive  \n\n\nThen mark accordingly in and harvest the datasets.\n\n\n8) What does it mean when it says \"checking out this url will unlock url: xxx\"?\n\n\nThat means you have another URL checked out. In order to avoid an overlap in efforts, when you check out a URL only you can work on it. By checking out a new URL the previous one will be unlocked.\n\n\n9) What do I do when there is stuff listed in the Link URL section?\n\n\nIf there are a bunch of sub-sites listed that are \nnot\n links, then you are on the master entry; the child entries are therefore just advisory and you should try to make sure that your harvesting includes all of the datasets contained across them, but otherwise keep going.\n\n\nIf the Link URL section has a single URL listed and it's a link, you are on a child item, which is the wrong place. Click the link and work on the master record.\n\n\n10) How do I partition large \"parent\" URLs (e.g., to reduce the size of the download \n 5 GB)?\n\n\nFrom the \noverview pane\n, click \nAdd Url\n on the top right side of app. Add a URL for each child and enter a description indicating these new URLs are children to the \"parent URL\". Make sure the priority of each child is the same as the parent.\n\n\nCheck out the parent URL, and under \nResearch\n use \"Link Url\" link it to all of its children and add a description. Make sure the priority of each child is the same as the parent. Start harvesting each child.\n\n\n11) Wifi is kind of Slow, are there workarounds for a faster connection?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo as much of the work as possible remotely: spin up a VM (e.g., AWS EC2, Digital Ocean droplet) or something, \nssh\n to those machines and do the downloading to there. The fewer people that are using the bandwidth onsite for big things, the less congestion this network will have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTether your phone :), thought if you do be mindful of bandwidth caps and don't forget to plug in your charger!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12) Why can't I edit the harvesting section?\n\n\nArchivers is set up such that each URL moves through the stages of the workflow in sequence. In order to edit the \nHarvesting\n section, you will first need to mark \nResearch\n as complete. Look for the checkbox on the right-hand side at the top of the \nResearch\n section. Once you've checked it, make sure to hit \nSave\n.\n\n\n13) When harvesting, why doesn't clicking on the \nDownload Zipstarter\n button work?\n\n\nUnfortunately this is a known issue. Make sure you've marked \nResearch\n complete. Try reloading the page, or switching browsers if you can.\n\n\nThe App is not compatible with Safari.\n\n\n14) In the \nResearch\n section, what are all the checkboxes for?\n\n\nPlease read the DataRescue Workflow documentation for more info!\n\n\n15) I have a process improvement that would make this go better!\n\n\nGreat! Open an issue in the \narchivers.space GitHub repository\n, or report it in the appropriate channel in your Slack team.\n\n\n16) How do I add a new event?\n\n\nAdmins can add events under the \"Events\" tab. Regular users will have to ask an admin for help!\n\n\n17) What is the difference between Crawlable and Harvested?\n\n\nResearchers\n investigate whether URLs listed in the \nArchivers app\n need to be manually downloaded (harvested) or if they can be automatically saved (crawled) by the Internet Archive. The URLs listed as \nCrawlable\n were determined as such during that research phase and are submitted to the Internet Archive, they do not need to be harvested. \n\n\nThese URLs represent only a small portion of those submitted to the Internet Archive from DataRescue events. Most crawlable URLs are identified by \nSeeders\n at the beginning of the workflow and completely bypass the Archivers app.",
